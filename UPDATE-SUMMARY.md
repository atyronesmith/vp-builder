# Conversion Script Update Summary

## Updates Made to Align with multicloud-gitops Pattern

Based on analysis of the actual [multicloud-gitops](https://github.com/validatedpatterns/multicloud-gitops) reference pattern, the conversion script has been updated to remove configurations that were added but don't exist in the reference pattern.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Simplified values-global.yaml
**Before:**
- Included `git:` section with provider, account, email, and dev_revision
- Had extensive clusterGroup configuration
- Included namespace, targetRevision at global level

**After (matching multicloud-gitops):**
```yaml
global:
  pattern: <pattern-name>
  options:
    useCSV: false
    syncPolicy: Automatic
    installPlanApproval: Automatic

main:
  clusterGroupName: hub
  multiSourceConfig:
    enabled: true
    clusterGroupChartVersion: "0.9.*"
```

#### 2. Moved clusterGroup Configuration
- Moved clusterGroup configuration from `values-global.yaml` to `values-hub.yaml` where it belongs
- This matches the pattern where cluster-specific configuration is in cluster-specific files

#### 3. Updated values-secret.yaml.template
**Before:**
- Had git token configuration
- Used simpler secret structure

**After (matching multicloud-gitops):**
```yaml
version: "2.0"
secrets:
  - name: config-demo
    vaultPrefixes:
    - global
    fields:
    - name: secret
      onMissingValue: generate
      vaultPolicy: validatedPatternDefaultPolicy
```

### What Remains

The GitHub organization parameter is still used in:
- `pattern-metadata.yaml` for the gitOpsRepo URL
- The directory naming convention

This is appropriate as these are pattern-specific configurations that need to be customized.

### Benefits of These Changes

1. **Better Alignment**: The generated patterns now match the official reference pattern structure
2. **Simpler Configuration**: Less configuration to maintain and understand
3. **Future Compatibility**: Following the official pattern ensures compatibility with framework updates
4. **Clear Separation**: Global vs cluster-specific configuration is properly separated

### Usage Remains the Same

The script usage hasn't changed:
```bash
./scripts/convert-to-validated-pattern.sh <pattern-name> <source-repo> [github-org]
```

The github-org parameter is now primarily used for the pattern-metadata.yaml file rather than values configuration.
